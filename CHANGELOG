  - Fixed changelog again (published a "minor" rather than a "patch", bumping it up to 0.12.0 rather than the intended 0.11.1)

v 0.12.0

v 0.11.0

v 0.9.0
  - Messed up the update process previously and got the wrong version number in the changelog as a result. This should restore it.

v 0.2.0
  - Added Sublime's SystemVerilog grammar converted by jfrogget (https://github.com/Razer6/language-verilog/pull/13)
  - Re-added .v and .vh extensions
  - Added some of sabertazimi's snippets (https://github.com/Razer6/language-verilog/pull/20 - only the ones that weren't already accounted for by jfrogget's pull request)
  - I think jfrogget's pull request changes take care of https://github.com/Razer6/language-verilog/pull/24 as well
